This self-chosen honors project for the James Scholar Honors Program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign required a student enrolled in PSYC 220: Images of Mind to write a 3-5 page paper in the style of a journalist (think NYT) about a peer-reviewed neuroscience paper. The goal was to write in a way that captures the importance of the findings in an exciting and approachable way. A presentation on the research study was done in the last two weeks of the course in addition to the paper.

"Neural correlates of reduction in self-judgement after Mindful Self-Compassion training", D Joss. et al., is the explored research for this project, finding self-judgement was reduced significantly and self-compassion scores increased in participants after self-compassion training.
