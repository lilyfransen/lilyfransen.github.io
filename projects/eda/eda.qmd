This EDA explores trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths across Pennsylvania counties ranging from April 2020 to December 2022. My team examined how per-capita case rates relate to population size, as well as whether increased cases led to increased deaths. We used visualization methods like scatter plots and bar charts, and k-means clustering to identify any county-level patterns.
