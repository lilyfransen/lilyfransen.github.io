This research focused on mental health at the county-level, using national data. After completing an EDA, Poisson regression, and using machine learning models Random Forest and XGBoost, my team saw a weak correlation between provider density and number of poor mental health days, challenging the common assumption that increasing the amount of clinical providers in a particular region leads to better mental health outcomes overall. Instead, we saw lack of social/emotional support and feelings of loneliness lead as the strongest predictors of poor mental health days, reinforcing the importance of the social determinants of health.
