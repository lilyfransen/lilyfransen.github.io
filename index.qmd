Welcome to my website! I am a senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Interdisciplinary Health Science with minors in Health Administration, Public Health, and Psychology. I am interested in clinical research and data science, and passionate about developing creative, scalable solutions to reshape health systems.

I spend a lot of my personal time reading, making art, and cooking. If you are interested in some of my all-time favorite books, check out my bookshelf tab!
