**Kitchen Confidential**

**Jonathan Livingston Seagull**  
Richard Bach

<span style="font-size:0.80em; color:gray;">A 1970 novella about a seagull who wants to fly for the joy of flying, not a survival tool. It inspired my self-awareness, encouraged me to embrace my individuality, and helped me better recognize my potential. I have carried Jonathan's lessons with me since I read this years ago.</span>

![](assets/books/the_alchemist.jpg){class="book-cover"}  
**The Alchemist**  
Paulo Coelho

<span style="font-size:0.80em; color:gray;">A top-selling inspirational novel about a Spanish boy that journeys to the pyramids in Egypt to discover his Personal Legend and life's purpose. Incredibly deep and beautifully simple go hand-in-hand. This book introduced the concept of universal love to me and encouraged me to let my big dreams guide my life.</span>

**Norwegian Wood**  
Haruki Murakami

<span style="font-size:0.80em; color:gray;">This story follows Toru, a university student in Tokyo, and his young adulthood years of loss, love, mental health struggles, and grief. It is a nostalgic story with fascinating symbolism. I found it to be memorable and thought-provoking of the many meanings of existence and complexities of love.</span>

![](assets/books/virgin_suicides.jpg){class="book-cover"}   
**The Virgin Suicides**  
Jeffrey Eugenides

<span style="font-size:0.80em; color:gray;">A story set in 1970 suburban Detroit, following five doomed sisters and their  suicides that took place in one year. It is narrated by an obsessed group of neighborhood boys, which explored the male gaze and its destructive nature. Its portrayal of female interiority showed where many go wrong in representation of women, where often men objectify women and romanticize virginity/purity. A really interesting read that has inspired a lot of my own reflection of identity and autonomy as a young woman in a patriarchal world.</span>

![](assets/books/normal_people.jpg){class="book-cover"} 
**Normal People**  
Sally Rooney

<span style="font-size:0.80em; color:gray;">A popular story following a complex relationship between Marianne and Connell through four years of their adolescence. It is a beautiful representation of young romance but also an important examination of social class and its interactions in life. It is both heartbreaking and uplifting, I enjoyed reading about their journey together.</span>

![](assets/books/the_perks.jpg){class="book-cover"}  
**The Perks of Being a Wallflower**  
Stephen Chbosky

<span style="font-size:0.80em; color:gray;">An honest and funny coming-of-age story of a high school boy named Charlie. Very representative of the exciting and traumatic firsts of the teenage years. This was an enlightening story for me to read in my teenage years.</span>
